# Quantum-computing-and-its-threat-to-modern-day-security
Quantum computing threatens to upend our assumptions as to how secure commonly used cryptographic algorithms are. This paper takes a look at security, quantum computing in general and its threat to security and different approaches being adopted to ensure "Quantum-safe" algorithms are used in practice as soon as possible.
